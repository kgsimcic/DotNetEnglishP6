Contains a .bak file for a database I created that contains:
- two tables (issues and osSupportInfo), normalized to third normal form
- 20 stored procedures that query things like all open issues for a given product or a version of a product, or to search for all issues that contain a list of keywords in their description or resolution fields
- documentation for calling all of these procedures.
